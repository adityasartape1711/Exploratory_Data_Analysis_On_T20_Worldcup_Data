## T20 World Cup Data Analysis

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of T20 World Cup cricket data, focusing on match outcomes, player performances, and team statistics. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project provides insights into trends and patterns within the T20 World Cup series, helping to understand team performances, key players, and match dynamics.

### Project Description
The T20 World Cup Data Analysis project leverages multiple datasets that include match results, player lists, and various team metrics. By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, the project uncovers meaningful insights about cricket matches over the years, identifying the factors that contribute to a team’s success, examining player performance trends, and visualizing historical trends in the sport.

### Key Features
- Detailed statistical analysis of team and player performances across T20 World Cup tournaments.
- Visualizations to illustrate trends in match outcomes, batting and bowling rankings, and winning margins.
- Interactive plots for a more dynamic exploration of data.
- Advanced analysis techniques, such as clustering teams based on performance and cumulative margin analysis.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Clustering algorithms for grouping teams based on performance metrics.

   ```bash
   python src/data_cleaning.py
   python src/eda.py
   python src/visualization.py
   ```

### Results
The project generates various visualizations and statistical insights, including:
- Distribution and frequency of match outcomes over different years.
- Trends in batting and bowling rankings across teams.
- Comparative analysis of winning margins between teams.
- Clustering of teams based on performance metrics.

### Future Improvements
